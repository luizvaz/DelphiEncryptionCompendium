-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 History:     Beginning at Feb 1999 to Jul 1999

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Version 3.0

  Internet RFC2289 and RFC1760 One Time Password Routines added
  String Management (Converting) added
  Object Hiearchy changed, all THash_xxx,TCipher_xxx,TRandom_xxx and TCompress_xxx are
  now Descends from TProtection. Now, a multiple chaining from all above Classes supported.
  Now absolutly D2 compatible.

  Full reorganization, better Compilerversions Management.
  Speedup, i.E. Blowfish > 8 Mb/sec (fantastic :-), Q128 > 10 Mb/sec, 
           TEA > 6 Mb, IDEA > 2.5 Mb/sec, Twofish > 6 Mb/sec, all on PII 266MHz 
  Twofish changed, old was bad.
  In all Hashclasses changed the buggy Buffermanagement. 
  StrToBase64 and Base64ToStr changed and exchanged, now produce correct Results.
  Property "IncludeHashKey" removed, make TCipher Class uniform
 
  New Cipher Modes added, 
    cmCBCMAC, cmCTSMAC, cmCFBMAC - Message Authentication Codes, Input Data are readonly 
    cmCBC, cmCTS, cmCFB supportes now MAC's (Message Authentication Code)
    Demo to use these can You find in ResFrm.pas.  

  Old Cipher.pas splitted in two Files, Cipher.pas contains now a good Selection.
  Cipher1.pas contains all other Ciphers. In many cases are 40 Ciphers to big.
 
  New a TRandom Basicclass for Random Number Generation, 
  TRandom_LFSR (Linear Feedback Shift Register) a fast Implementation with variable
  Period from 2^64-1 to 2^2032-1 (astronomical :-), with using from Cipher.pas these
  Randomclasses are automaticly cryptographicaly secure.

  and many more...
  

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Version 2.3
   
  maked compatible with BCB 3 and 4, removed all abstract Methods and NewInstance Methods. 
  
  new:            Secure Random Number Generator with a Period 2^256-1
                  included in RNG.pas 
  added:          in Hash.pas and Cipher.pas Secure Random Number Generator Support

  specialy:       removed all fucking LOOP Statements in assembler core, 
                  it's slow and produced bad iteration
                  as result: all Checksums speeded very up and
                             all Ciphers in cmCBC and cmCTS Mode speeded up 
                             (i.E. TCipher_SCOP from 22 Mb/sec to 28 Mb/sec)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Version 2.2  
   
  added Cipher:   Square, all DES Cipher 7 types, Diamond II, Diamond II Lite, Sapphire II
  added Hash:	  SHA, Square, Sapphire II (128, 160, 192, 224, 256, 288, 320)
  added Checksum: CRC16-CCITT Norm, CRC16-Standard Norm (XModem, ARC)

  bugfixes:       CRC32 offset Problem and in THash_CRC32.Done inverse the Result
                  Overlapping in TCipher.InternalCodeStream
                  DecodeString was called EncodeBuffer, now Decodebuffer

  added:	  ProgressEvent (Gauges) for Cipher's and Hash's
		  Event OnProgress from TCipherManager and THashManager

  added:          more Examples

  changed:        DEC1 API, added a Demo to using DEC1.DLL
      
                  cmCTS Mode, XOR's the Data before and now after the encryption.
                  This has better Securityeffect when using a InitVector, the Output is
                  secure when a bad InitVector is used, ca 1% Speed lossed
                  cmCBC Mode is now equal to the old cmCTS Mode.  


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Version 2.1
   
  added:          Self-Test support, Methods TCipher.SelfTest and TCipher.TestVector
                                     Methods THash.SelfTest and THash.TestVector
 
                  Cipher KeySize-checking, Method TCipher.InitBegin()

  added Cipher:   TEAN, SCOP (very fast), Q128, 3Way, Twofish, Shark
  added Hash:     Snefru, RipeMD128, RipeMD256, RipeMD320, Tiger


  added Rounds for THaval_xxxx, from 3-5 

        3 Rounds 174 % faster than with 5 Rounds, PII 266 12.74 Mb/sec
        4 Rounds 121 % faster than with 5 Rounds, PII 266  8.88 mb/sec
        5 Rounds                                  PII 266  7.32 mb/sec

        THash_Haval256           default Rounds is 5
        THash_Haval224 / 192     default Rounds is 4
        THash_Haval160 / 128     default Rounds is 3

  added in TCipherManager: Methods EncodeString(), DecodeString(), 
                                   EncodeBuffer(), DecodeBuffer()

  added Low Level API in unit DEC_API.pas and Low Level DLL for use without Delphi


  changed:        Endian conversions routines, SwapInteger and SwapIntegerBuffer 
                  use now Processor specific code to speedup the conversion

  bug fixes:      assember code in XORBuffers save now register EDI
                  TCipher.EncodeString and DecodeString changed,
                  old code produced Access Violation's

  speeded up:     TCipher_Cast128   145 %
                  TCipher_Cast256   118 %
                  TCipher_Blowfish  130 %

                  TCipher_Mars      125 %

  speeded up:     THash_MD4         137 %
                  THash_MD5         126 %
                  THash_SHA1        134 % for <= 386   and 148 % for >= 486 CPU
                  THash_RipeMD160   140 %
                  THash_Haval       173 %
